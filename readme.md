# Python utilities

This is a repo containing utilities built using python, these utilities were built in my spare time.
It can range from stuff that were built just for curiosity to functions that can actually add value to your program.

This is a python utility that can fetch the complete path of any file be it within a directory or subdirectories inside a target parent directory.
- Can resolve the complete path from incomplete filename.
- Can look into directories and their subdirectories to find the file.
